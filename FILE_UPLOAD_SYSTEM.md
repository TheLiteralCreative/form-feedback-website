## Form Integration

### Form Builder Integration
1. Form builder allows adding file upload fields with:
   - Customizable file type restrictions
   - Size limit settings
   - Required/optional status
   - Number of files allowed

### User Configuration
Users can specify:
- Allowed file types
- Maximum file sizes
- Required/optional status
- Number of files allowed per upload
- Custom validation rules

### Processing Flow
1. Form submissions handle regular data and file uploads in parallel
2. Files are stored with references to the form submission
3. Metadata is updated in real-time
4. Progress is tracked and reported

### Error Handling
- Invalid file types
- Size limit exceeded
- Upload failures
- Network issues
- Storage quota exceeded

## Technical Implementation

### Firebase Storage Setup
```typescript
// firebase-storage.ts
interface StorageConfig {
  maxFileSize: number;
  allowedTypes: string[];
  storageBucket: string;
}

class FirebaseStorage {
  // Storage initialization
  // Upload methods
  // Download methods
  // Delete methods
}
```

### Upload Handlers
```typescript
// upload-handlers.ts
interface UploadOptions {
  maxConcurrent: number;
  chunkSize: number;
  retryAttempts: number;
}

class UploadHandler {
  // Upload queue management
  // Progress tracking
  // Error handling
  // Retry logic
}
```

### File Validators
```typescript
// file-validators.ts
interface ValidationRules {
  maxSize: number;
  allowedTypes: string[];
  requireSignature: boolean;
}

class FileValidator {
  // Type checking
  // Size validation
  // Signature verification
  // Custom validation rules
}
```

## Best Practices

### Performance
- Use chunked uploads
- Implement proper error handling
- Optimize file processing
- Cache previews when possible

### Security
