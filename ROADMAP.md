## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Architecture
```typescript
// Core routing structure
const routes = {
  public: {
    landing: '/',
    login: '/login',
    register: '/register',
    form: '/f/:formId'
  },
  dashboard: {
    overview: '/dashboard',
    forms: '/dashboard/forms',
    analytics: '/dashboard/analytics',
    settings: '/dashboard/settings'
  }
};

// State management
interface AppState {
  user: {
    workspace: WorkspaceConfig;
    preferences: UserPreferences;
  };
  forms: {
    active: FormState;
    list: FormMetadata[];
    cache: Record<string, FormState>;
  };
  ui: {
    theme: ThemeConfig;
    navigation: NavigationState;
  };
}
```

### Backend Services
```typescript
// Firebase service configuration
const services = {
  auth: {
    providers: ['email', 'google'],
    customClaims: ['role', 'workspace']
  },
  firestore: {
    collections: {
      workspaces: WorkspaceSchema,
      forms: FormSchema,
      responses: ResponseSchema,
      analytics: AnalyticsSchema
    }
  },
  storage: {
    buckets: {
      uploads: {
        maxSize: '100MB',
        allowedTypes: ['image/*', 'application/pdf']
      }
    }
  }
};
```
